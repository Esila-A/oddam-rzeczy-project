### About 
This is a website I created for my JavaScript Developer bootcamp. I was given a design and asked to recreate it (the design was made for only a desktop version - that's why the website is not responsive).<br/><br/>
The basic requirements for this project were to create a homepage (including a form and pagination section) and sign-up, sing-in and sing-out pages. The buttons on the website were supposed to take users to the sign-in page.<br/><br/>
Additionally, to make a bit more advanced version, we could add to the website an actual registration and login/logout functionalities. If did so, the buttons, depending on the user status, were supposed to take a user to the sign-in page or a "giveaway" form. Also, the menu options were partly to change.<br/><br/>
In this project the most challenging parts were the reginstration and pagination ones, as both were very new to me and I didn't know how to tackle them at all. After a lot of searching and learning I decided to apply a Firebase Authentication to the registration functionality, and a Firebase Database to the pagination section.
